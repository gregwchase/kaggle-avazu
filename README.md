# Kaggle - Avazu CTR Prediction

## Overview
In 2014, Kaggle hosted a competition, whereby participants were asked to predict the probability of an ad being clicked.

This competition was the very first I undertook as an undergraduate. In 2018, I revisited the competition, in an attempt to beat my own results, and using new libraries to gain similar or better results.
